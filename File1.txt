I release things that have held me back I have no use for them
No matter how I am feeling, I simply begin I am able to build momentum to accomplish anything
I find it easier to say no to distractions everyday I am able to stay on track
By keeping organized and utilizing my time wisely, procrastination melts away
I work hard first and play later
I always start a project right away
I am someone who seizes the moment and takes action
I complete projects with plenty of time to spare
I am changing into someone who effortlessly gets things done
Making things happen is just what I do
